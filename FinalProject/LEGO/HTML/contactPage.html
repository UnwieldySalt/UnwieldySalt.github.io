            There are many pieces in a Lego Set that may be cause of harm for 
            children under the age of 10. <br> <br>
            Potential hazards could be a result from:<br>
            1. Ingestion of small lego pieces <br>
            2. Injuries due to pointy lego pieces <br>
            3. Injuries resulting from electrical components in a set. <br><br>
            Please look out for for warning labels such as this one to make to
            assess the safety of a specific set for your child.<br><br>
